# ASCII Art

This program was created as a semestral project at my university as part of a subject named BI-OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It's my first MVC-like app that I've ever written. I wrote this in my third semester of studies - 12/2019.

The subject's intention was to ephasise the importance of some OOP techniques as well as clean code (as clean as it was possible for the time and experience I had). It's was also the first time that I used mocking and unit testing.

### How to run the program

You will need to provide an input .jpg (.jpeg) or .png image with a launch option `+--image <path_to_image>+`. Then, you need to decide how the result is supposed to be output. Choose `+--output-file <output_path>+` or `+--output-console+` for the result to be printed directly to the console. You can combine the two previous options. Finally, the program offers a `+--invert+` option which inverts color for each pixel before converting to ASCII art.

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, to add the program's arguments you need to adjust the setting by going to upper menu bar: `+Run > Edit Configurations..+`, field `+Program Arguments+` will do the job for you (using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3.1). Don't forget to build the project at first, you may see no configurations whatsoever otherwise.
